# Epipolar-geometry-using-The-real-fundamental-matrix
Two images are given in files ‘img1.png’ and ‘img2.png’. The file ‘points_inlier.mat’ includes 20 pair of corresponding points in the images.

First, we compute the fundamental matrix using these points, Showing points and epipolar lines on images.
Now using 'points.mat' we know half of the pairs are inliers and the other
half are outliers. We use RANSAC and the 8-point algorithm, and we Implemented a program to find the fundamental matrix using
these points.
